Using animation, the project takes viewers on a journey from the peaceful hills of Sreemangal to the tea gardens, and finally to modern urban Sylhet. Key scenes include a morning train moving along the railway through the misty hills of Sreemangal , tea workers plucking tea leaves and placing them into bamboo baskets, while a tea seller prepares tea beside a small stall; and at the airport, one plane is landing as another takes off, with a stadium situated nearby and another vehicles are also moving at the road â€” all portrayed with cultural accuracy and artistic depth.
